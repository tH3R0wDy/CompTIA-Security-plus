1.4
Threats, Attacks and Vulnerability
a)Penetration testing
b)Info Gathering/Discovery/Reconnaissance: Active vs Passive
c)Types of testing: Non Intrusive(vulnerability scans) vs Intrusive(exploiting vulnerabilities) 
d)Penetration testing vs Vulnerability Scanning vs Risk Assessment

1.5
Explaining Vulnerability scanning concepts
a)Vulnerability Scanning Process: Passively test controls
					                          Identify vulnerability/system flaw/unpatched code
								  identity lack of security controls
								  identity common misconfigurations by reviewing system settings, policies, or rule sets.

Types of Vulnerability scanning:
1)Intrusive vs non intrusive
2)credentialed vs non credentialed
3)false positive

Note: There is no exploitation in vulnerability assessment.

1.6

					  Improper input handling
					  Improper error handling
